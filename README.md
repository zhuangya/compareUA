compareUA
=========

_Nothing_ special around here. Just a little `user-agent` tool for myself, and anyone need.

This little require redis database, so I think you should go and [get](http://redis.io) one.

It's pretty awesome.

I'll update the UI and functionality.

It's my very first nodejs project, if you have any thing want to say, please let me [know](http://zhuangya.me)
